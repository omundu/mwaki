<h1>Projects that I'm Working on</h1>

<h2>Nanoc on Heroku</h2>

<p>So I've decided to take this a step further and host my little Nanoc site on Heroku. It initially looked like it would be no problem at all. All i'd have to do is create a Heroku repo and a config.ru file to point to the output file as root. Simple enough :).</p>

<h2>In the beginning</h2>

<p>if setting this site up does not count, then none at the moment...might find myself shamed into working on something now that this is out in the open.</P>
