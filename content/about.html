<h1>The About Page</h1>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>I was curious about static site generators, so I chose one and decided to try it out. Hopefully this leads to some worthwhile experiences, if it doesn't, I'll put it down to that was fun.</p>

<h2>Me...abridged</h2>

<p>I'm a native of the happy weather of Nairobi where the interesting people, varying cultures, and unique geography combined to give the best experiences any kid growing up could wish for. It is where I discovered my love for rugby, interest in the environment, and curiosity on the economic development of countries. Along with those, Nairobi also taught me to roll up my windows in traffic, wear no jewelry, and a (maybe unhealthy) fear of people in uniform. If I am to pick one thing that Nairobi gave me, it will be that it helped me develop an attitude of approaching situations in a relaxed manner...allowing me to appear level-headed through any crisis.</p>

<h2>What of Technology...</h2>

<p>I was originally introduced to computers through the DOS game "Pole Postion" and after some initial fustration and lack of resources I was received regular access to a computer and never looked back. A hand-me-down Toshiba laptop that had been deemed obsolete provided me with the freedom to play with hardware, operating systems, and general software without being concerned with keeping the machine in full working condition at all times. This fanned an interest that saw me take Computer Scince classes as a fun aside to my Economics concentration...an interest that saw eventually add Computer Science as a second major. After college, I wrote web applications using Ruby on Rails professionally and for fun...an activity that I have and continue to enjoy.</p>
