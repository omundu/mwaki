      <h1>Projects that I'm Working on</h1>

<h2>Sinatra Scrapper</h2>

<p>I've always found playing with new things fun. As I was trying to do work on <i>Cars for Teens</i>, I found myself enjoying Nokogiri's general awesomeness and wanted to play with that some more. I had also wanted, for the longest time, to play around with Sinatra since I had heard so many good things. I therefore found a fun-looking tutorial and went for it and the initial product can now be viewed <a href="https://omundu930.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">here</a>. I hope to transfer some of the learnings I picked up from this fun little project onto the <i>Cars for Teens</i> project that I'm currently refusing to finish.</p>

<h2>Cars for Teens</h2>

<p>I have always loved cars...my first love was in fact a <a href="http://jalopnik.com/lancia-delta-integrale-jalopnik-fantasy-garage-1588327869" target="_blank">Lancia Delta Integrale</a> but that's a story for another day. So when I saw that the IHSS had released a list of cars that they considered safe for teens, I went over to find out what their recomndatiosn were. I found the process of checking out each individual car annoyingly slow...so I started to look at a ways to improve it...and still in the planning stages.</p>

<h2>Technical Reviewer</h2>
<a href="https://bitly.com/heroku-cookbook"><h3><i>Heroku Cookbook</i> by Mike Coutermarsh</h3></a>

<p>My good friend, <a href="https://mikecoutermarsh.com" target="_blank">Mike</a> invited me to be one of the technical reviewers for his well-written and extremely helpful <i>"Heroku Cookbook"</i>. Was a fun project, I learnt alot and I do hope people find it as useful as I did.</p>

<h2>World Cup Survivor</h2>

<p>An attempt to have a site where one can place bets on who will win or lose a game in the FIFA World Cup. Technical and time constraints left it in a semi-completed state. The idea is still fun and I intend to try and finish it at some point. The WIP can be viewed at <a href="http://worldcupsurvivor.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</P>

<h2>nanoc...then host it on Heroku</h2>

<p>It was simple enought, I wanted to know what this nanoc thing was about so I went ahead and installed the gem and got to typing. After some time I realized that the site would need to live somewhere other than my laptop so I explore possible hosting options...from github pages to setting up my own little server from a cloud service. But what I really wanted was the extremely simple code and push functionality that Heroku Toolbelt provided. After running out of patience with Dokku, (still on the back-burner), I went with Heroku as a temporary solution.</p>

<p>At this point, I've decided to take this a step further and host my little nanoc site on Heroku. Beacuase simply uploading the files made too much sense (and I could not figure out how to do it), I set it up as a Sinatra static server. So not the most efficient way to have a static application up and running but I'm all smiles for it. :).</p>
